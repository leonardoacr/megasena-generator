This is a personal project that utilizes statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms to generate lottery numbers for the Mega-Sena, the biggest lottery game in Brazil.

## :camera: Overview

<br>
<br>
The Mega-Sena game generator employs historical frequency data and standard deviation to calculate the probability of specific number combinations appearing in future lottery draws. In addition, advanced machine learning algorithms, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and ARIMA models, are utilized to analyze past patterns and provide accurate predictions for future lottery outcomes.

<br>
<br>
This repository contains the code for the Mega-Sena game generator, along with detailed documentation on how to use the program to generate lottery numbers. While statistical analysis and machine learning can provide valuable insights and predictions, it's important to note that there is no guarantee of winning the lottery. Even with predictions based on tendencies observed in moving average graphs and highly accurate results from the RNN, the standard deviation is still too high to accurately predict a specific number. Ultimately, the probabilities of guessing the correct numbers are the same as those when choosing numbers randomly.
<br>
<br>
In summary, the network was trained on 60% of a total of 2579 games, validated and corrected using 20%, and tested with the remaining data. The network predicts the next outcome based on a sequence of 5 previous games. However, due to a high standard deviation, even if a trend is detected in the moving average, the prediction remains random like any other guess. Moreover, an interesting observation is that I compared the frequency curve of independent positions with the Gaussian distribution, which can be approximated when the game data is organized in ascending order by position frequency.
<br>
<br>
Obviously, it is not possible to predict lottery results and no relevant pattern was found. In the verification stage using Chi-Square, it was noticed that, as expected, the raw data is non-stationary in all positions. To overcome this situation, I used a controlled analysis window with a moving average, which allowed me to use the data as input in LSTM and ARIMA models.
<br>
<br>
As a conclusion, this project aimed to apply data science topics with Python, experiment a bit with Django, deploy on AWS EC2 with Nginx directly from the Linux terminal, and also on PythonAnywhere. I also put into practice some concepts that I learned in previous courses of React with TypeScript. Below is the link to the deployment, along with the GitHub repository containing documentation and all the steps I mentioned.

Swagger is not allowing access in production mode, so you can check all routes cloning the app and running it in a localhost:<br>
http://localhost:8000/swagger

<br>
Here is the Swagger route screenshot:<br>

The code is divided into 4 main projects:

- Jupyter Notebook: This was the initial approach to the problem, offering a detailed description of each feature on the app, and providing deep statistical analysis. In addition, the Jupyter Notebook also used advanced machine learning algorithms, such as LSTM and ARIMA, to predict future lottery outcomes. However, these models were not implemented on the website as they required too much processing power to run.

  - LSTM models are a type of recurrent neural network that can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them well-suited for time-series prediction tasks like lottery number generation.

  - ARIMA models, on the other hand, are a statistical method for analyzing and forecasting time-series data.

- Datascience: The statistical data based on historical frequency, created in the Jupyter Notebook, was implemented on Python scripts. These scripts provide data to the backend.

- Backend: The backend was made with Python using the Django Framework, which serves an API that provides the frontend with data from the datascience scripts. Swagger was used to describe all the routes.

- Frontend: The frontend was made with React, using NextJS and TailwindCSS, fully responsive with desktops and mobile. It's responsible for presenting the website's interface and showing data through interactive dashboards and outputs.
